[Qualification file](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TVyQebUYA6txEakMrj76kg2Z0es4XqVa)

In this test assignment i created a Procedural Dungeon Generator.
I used Seeding and Perlin noise to generate the dungeon.

## Features

- [Seeding](link)
- [Perlin noise](link)

## Software Anaylsis

For this test assignment i will be using Unity C#.
I chose Unity C# for a couple of reasons.
- Unity allows me to create this assignment in a three dimensional space, which will be an extra challenge for me.
- I can learn a lot about Unity, since i only use it when it is required.
- Using & creating two dimensional arrays in C# is fairly easy compared to two dimensional arrays in JavaScript.
- After some research, seeding in JavaScript seems to take weeks to write correctly.

## Learning goals

- Seeding.
- Perlin noise generation.
